### Project goal by martin-stepwolf :goal_net:

Personal project to learn [Symfony framework](https://symfony.com/). 

### Achievements :star2:

As Laravel programmer I achieved:

- Learn [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) and the [Forms](https://symfony.com/doc/current/forms.html).
- Implemented entities, their relationship and CRUD (all with almost only commands).
- Implemented authentication and register modules.
- Managed the security, routes, entities, controllers etc.
- Implemented design and styles (with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - [documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend.html)).
- Implemented [Fixtures](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html) to fill the database with fake data.
- Implemented docker compose for a better environment.

## Getting Started üöÄ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites üìã

The programs you need are:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
-   [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Installing üîß

Note: The database configuration are defined in .env, and its used in docker-compose, if you want to personalize it create a copy from .env to .env.local and/or create a docker-compose.override.yml:

First create the image (php:7.4-composer-npm) and run the services (php, nginx and mysql):

```
docker-compose up
```

Note: The next steps can be automated by running

```
sh ./install.sh
```

Then install the dependencies.

```
docker-compose exec app composer install
docker-compose exec app npm install
```

Then generate the database

```
docker-compose exec app php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
```

Finally load the fake set of data into the database:

```
docker-compose exec app php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

## Running the project :computer:

### CSS files

Each time SASS files are updated you need to run:

```
docker-compose exec app npm run dev
```

To make it automated run:

```
docker-compose exec app npm run watch
```

And now you have all the environment, the nginx server is in the port 8000 (e.g http://127.0.0.1:8000/).

## Functionality ‚öôÔ∏è

- In /register you can create an account as normal user ["ROLE_APPLICANT"].
- To be Administrator, set in the database ["ROLE_ADMIN"] in roles column.
- As Administrator you can create companies with a normal user as reference(to log in).
- As company ["ROLE_COMPANY"] you can create offers.
- As normal user you can watch and apply to offers.
